    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe makes just the taco meat. You have to buy everything else, of
      course. Make a big batch and use for a multiple of different meals: add to
      bean burritos for a more hearty and tasty burrito, or add a can of beans
      (kidney, red, or pinto) and use for Frito® Pie, Navajo tacos, or taco
      salad.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon celery salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C)</li>
      <li>
        Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable
        freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken
        with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Season
        chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
      <li>
        Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken breasts,
        evenly coating both sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the
        bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each
        breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 cup olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it
        begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2
        minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with about 1/3 cup of
        tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella
        cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan
        over top and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and
        chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
        165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
    </ol>
